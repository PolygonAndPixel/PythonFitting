### PythonFitting
In this script I am using different calculations to fit some data to a function.
These fits are solutions some tasks of the course **Modellierung I** by Prof. Michael Wand
at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz. 
I give no guarantee for correctness, style or efficiency (which is obvious if 
you look at my matrix-matrix multiplication for instance). However if you want
to see some basic implementations, feel free to take a look, copy some code and
play with it.
If you want to get to know something about style, please visit 
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) or use at least
[pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) which has some nice GUI interfaces like 
[Spyder IDE](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder).

## The fits

# Linear interpolation between two datapoints

# Polynomial interpolation

# Linear interpolation with least squares

# Polynomial interpolation with least squares

# Exponential interpolation with least squares

# L1-Norm interpolation 

# M-Estimator
