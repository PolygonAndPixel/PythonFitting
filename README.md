### PythonFitting
In this script I am using different calculations to fit some data to a function.
These fits are solutions to the course **Modellierung I** by Prof. Michael Wand
at the Johannes Gutenberg-University in Mainz. 
I give no guarantee for correctness, style or efficiency (which is obvious if 
you look at my matrix-matrix multiplication for instance). However if you want
to see some basic implementations, feel free to take a look, copy some code and
play with it.
